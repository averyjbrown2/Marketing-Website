# Marketing-Website


Marketing Website

This refactor was completed in an effort to make the code more accessible to webpage visitors, more readable and concise to other developers, and to further my own skills as I continue to learn more about web development.

As I worked through this project, the issue that gave me the greatest challenge, of course, turned out to require the simplest solution. Since the beginning of my development journey, I learned to never forget the basics. This project was no exception.
